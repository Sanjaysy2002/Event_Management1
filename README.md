# Event_Management1

In this project we use J2EE,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap,JQuery and MySql technologies.
the main purpose of this project is to help the end users to book their Events online with the help of our portal.
In this project we did Validations using JQuery, and We did this project in MVC(Model View controll) architecture, In this project first we move from View  and it will identify the controller with URL pattern then it will move to Model and in the model we are communicate with the Database. this is the outer line about this project.
Still i work on this project to develop the front-end and now im learing the BootStrap, with the help of bootstrap  the web pages are looks good compare to HTML and CSS so that is the reason i focus on Bootstrap.
thank you.
